                Hello, my name is Cedric Pierre-Louis! I am a currently a sophmore at University of Maryland
                studying computer science. My passion for computer science comes from being immersed in technology
                ever since I was young. I've always been intrigued in learning how different devices and computer systems work.
                I am currently working on honing my skills in essential computer science skills and hoping to begin my career journey
                as a software engineer. As I dive deeper into computer science, I hope to break into the data science/machine learning field and
                become a Machine Learning Engineer! Thank you for visiting my webpage and joining me on my tech development journey!
            </p>
